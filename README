Autoloadify is a utility for PHP developers.

When your script encounters an undfined class, Autoloadify gives you options to create the class on the fly based on a template file.

Upon creating the class, Autoloadify
- creates the directory (if new) to the class file
- creates the class file
- populates the file with the template you selected
- adds the directory (if new) to the autoload register


-- INSTALLATION --
1. Copy Autoloadify.php and the templates folder into your classes or includes directory
2. Require and instantiate the class in a file in the root level of your app
*** See example.php ***

-- USAGE --
- When writing code, write in class calls as if the classes have been declared.
- Run the script. It will automatically prompt you to create the new classes.
- When you submit the form, the current page will be reloaded with the new class autoloaded.

-- TEMPLATES --
- Change/add template files in /autoloadify_templates/
- Change the directory of your templates folder in Autoloadify::templatesDir
- Underscores in template filenames signify a default directory the file will be created in.

Example:
autoloadify_templates/some_folder_controller.php 
will suggest the class be created in /some/folder/

A template file WITHOUT any underscores will suggest the class be created
in the folder where you put Autoloadify.php

-- TODO FEATURES --
- Add additional form fields for template variables in addition to {CLASSNAME}
- Selecting a template populates a text area where you can write the new class in browser
